EXODUs Board Game (Trouble)
===========================

How to play:
Each player has four pegs which start in the home position. You must first roll a 6 to move a peg to start position. Once in start position, you may roll the die to advance your peg across the board clockwise. If a peg lands on a spot occupied by an opponent, the opposing peg(s) are sent back to home. Up to four pegs may occupy the same space if each belong to the same player, the exception being in the finish position.


How To Win:
Advance all four of your pegs to the finish position.
